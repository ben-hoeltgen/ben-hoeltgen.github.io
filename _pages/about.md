By asking foundational questions about machine learning and its use, I hope to help shaping the development and deployment of `artificial intelligenceÂ´ in a way that is beneficial and not harmful to society. I have been thinking especially about the interpretation and evaluation of probabilistic predictions and about the relation between individuals and groups.  

Before my PhD, I have worked a little on moral psychology, philosophy of science, causal discovery, XAI, and efficient training of large ML models.


### My background (more details [here](https://benedikthoeltgen.github.io/cv/))

I initially studied maths (with some physics) and then also philosophy (with some literature and languages) in [Munich](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/m%C3%BCnchen-isar-br%C3%BCcke), inevitably leading to a master's in mathematical philosophy at the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html). After that, I completed a master's in computer science in [Oxford](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/oxford), with a focus on machine learning. This led to a research assistantship  where I worked on coding-heavy projects such as active learning with language models. I started my PhD in [TÃ¼bingen](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/t%C3%BCbingen) with [Bob Williamson](https://fm.ls/bob) in September 2022. As an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student, I am co-supervised by [Nuria Oliver](https://ellisalicante.org/people/nuriaoliver-en/) in [Alicante](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/alicante), where I spent the winter 2024/25.


### Other

I am also trying to help foster interdisciplinary collaboration (co-developing an [app](https://catalyst-app.org/)), enhance the visibility of female and non-binary scientists (co-organising [Soapbox Science TÃ¼bingen](https://soapboxsciencetuebingen.github.io/)), and generally make academia a more healthy place (as a [mental heath first aider](https://mhfainternational.org/), a 'confidant' contact person in the [TÃ¼bingen AI community](https://tappa-org.github.io/), and promoting [mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04240-1) awareness).

Outside of work, I enjoy (among other things) literature, music, travelling (especially visiting friends), and all sorts of sports.
