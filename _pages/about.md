By asking foundational questions about machine learning and its use, I hope to help shaping the development and deployment of `artificial intelligence´ in a way that is beneficial and not harmful to society. I have been thinking especially about the interpretation and evaluation of probabilistic predictions and about the relation between individuals and groups.  


### My background (you can find a more detailed CV [here](https://benedikthoeltgen.github.io/cv/))

I initially studied maths (with some physics) and then also philosophy (with some literature and languages) in [Munich](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/m%C3%BCnchen-isar-br%C3%BCcke), inevitably leading to a master's in mathematical philosophy at the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html). After that, I completed a master's in computer science in [Oxford](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/oxford), with a focus on machine learning. This led to a research assistantship with people in the [OATML](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk/) group where I worked on coding-heavy projects such as active learning with language models. I started my PhD in [Tübingen](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/t%C3%BCbingen) with [Bob Williamson](https://fm.ls/bob) in September 2022. As an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student, I am co-supervised by [Nuria Oliver](https://ellisalicante.org/people/nuriaoliver-en/) in [Alicante](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/alicante), where I spent the winter 2024/25.
