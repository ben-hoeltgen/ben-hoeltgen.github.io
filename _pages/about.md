By asking foundational questions about machine learning and its use, I hope to help shaping the development and deployment of 'artificial intelligence' in a way that is beneficial and not harmful to society. I have been thinking especially about the interpretation and evaluation of probabilities, the interplay between individuals and groups, and the implicit choices and assumptions that are often glossed over in ML theory and practice.  

Before my PhD, I have worked a little on moral psychology, philosophy of science, causal discovery, XAI, and efficient training of large ML models (see my [publications](https://ben-hoeltgen.github.io/publications/)).


### My background (see my [CV](https://ben-hoeltgen.github.io/cv/))

I initially studied maths (with physics) and then also philosophy (with literature and languages) in [Munich](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/m%C3%BCnchen-isar-br%C3%BCcke), inevitably leading to a master's in mathematical philosophy at the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html). After that, I completed a master's in computer science in [Oxford](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/oxford), with a focus on machine learning. I continued to work there with the OATML group as a research assistant, mostly on coding-heavy projects such as active learning with LLMs. I started my PhD in [Tübingen](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/t%C3%BCbingen) with [Bob Williamson](https://fm.ls/bob) in September 2022. As an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student, I am co-supervised by [Nuria Oliver](https://ellisalicante.org/people/nuriaoliver-en/) in [Alicante](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/alicante), where I spent the winter 2024/25.


### Other

Beyond my own research, I am also trying to help foster interdisciplinary collaboration (co-developing an [app](https://catalyst-app.org/)), enhance the visibility of female and non-binary scientists (co-organising [Soapbox Science Tübingen](https://soapboxsciencetuebingen.github.io/)), and generally make academia a more healthy place (as a [mental heath first aider](https://mhfainternational.org/), a 'confidant' contact person in the [Tübingen AI community](https://tappa-org.github.io/), and promoting [mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04240-1) awareness).

Outside of work, I enjoy (among other things) literature, music, travelling (especially to visit friends), and all sorts of sports.
