As a researcher trained in mathematics, philosophy, and computer science, I am comfortable crossing the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Drawing on diverse perspectives and scholarship, I strive to make contributions across fields, and in particular to the transdisciplinary understanding of machine learning systems in society. My research focuses on the plausibility and impact of mathematical assumptions and technical modelling choices of 'AI' systems in social contexts. 

I also have worked a little on moral psychology, philosophy of science, causal discovery, XAI, and efficient training of large ML models (see my [publications](https://ben-hoeltgen.github.io/publications/)).


### My background

I initially studied maths (with physics) and then also philosophy (with literature and languages) in [Munich](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/m%C3%BCnchen-isar-br%C3%BCcke), inevitably leading to a master's in mathematical philosophy at the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html). After that, I completed a master's in computer science in [Oxford](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/oxford), with a focus on machine learning. I continued to work there with the OATML group as a research assistant, mostly on coding-heavy projects such as active learning with LLMs. I started my PhD in [Tübingen](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/t%C3%BCbingen) with [Bob Williamson](https://fm.ls/bob) in 2022 and submitted my thesis in January 2026, titled _The Construction of Algorithmic Predictions in Society_. As an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student, I was co-supervised by [Nuria Oliver](https://ellisalicante.org/people/nuriaoliver-en/) in [Alicante](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/alicante), where I spent the winter 2024/25. I am now an independent researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute's [Data & AI](https://hpi.de/en/research/clusters/data-and-ai/) cluster in [Potsdam](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/search/potsdam).


### Other

In the service of science more broadly, I am also engaged in efforts to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration (developing a [platform](https://catalyst-app.org/)), increase the visibility of female and non-binary scientists (organising events for [Soapbox Science](https://soapboxsciencetuebingen.github.io/) and [TWiML](https://tuewiml.github.io/)), and support well-being in academia (as a [mental health first aider](https://mhfainternational.org/), a ['confidant'](https://tappa-org.github.io/confidants/) contact person in the Tübingen AI community, and a promoter of [mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04240-1) awareness).

Outside of work, I enjoy (among other things) literature, music, travelling (especially to visit friends), and all sorts of sports.
